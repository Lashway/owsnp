This  project  describes  the  development  of  a  combined software  and  hardware platform for a health monitoring wireless sensor network. I have developed several medical  sensors  based  on  the  open  source  Arduino microcontroller  boards including: pulse oximeters, a 2  lead electro cardiogram board, activity and free fall sensor,  barometric  pressure  sensor,  humidity  sensor,  ambient temperature  sensor and  light sensor.  I have also developed a network real-time data visualization  too along with a persistent data storage  layer, a web service  interface and web service clients.
